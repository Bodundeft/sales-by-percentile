# 1. Theme Management:

### The theme_plotly variable is currently set to None. If you want to customize the Plotly chart theme, you can explore options provided by px.theme or other styling libraries.

# 2. Numerical Analysis:

### The code currently only handles categorical analysis (value counts) if the user selects "Categorical" in the radio button. You could add functionalities like histograms or descriptive statistics for numerical columns.


# "You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser."

### This indicates that your Streamlit application has started running successfully. Streamlit is a Python library used to create interactive web applications. When you run a Streamlit script, it starts a local web server that hosts your application.

### "Local URL: http://localhost:8501"

### localhost: This refers to your local machine.
### 8501: This is the default port number that Streamlit uses to run the application.
### Therefore, "http://localhost:8501" is the URL you can access to view your app in your web browser if you are on the same machine ### where the Streamlit application is running.

### "Network URL: http://192.168.207.5:8501"

### 192.168.207.5: This is the IP address of your machine on your local network.
### "http://192.168.207.5:8501" is the URL you can use to access your Streamlit app from other devices on the same local network as your machine.

## In summary:

### You have two ways to access your Streamlit app:
### Locally: http://localhost:8501 (from the same machine)
### Network: http://192.168.207.5:8501 (from other devices on the same network)
